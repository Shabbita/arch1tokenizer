Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
# Instructions:

You should document your tokenizer in this file.

This file is written in the refreshingly simple `markdown` text
formatting language.

To learn about text formatting using markdown, we encourage you to examine 
 - [../README.md](../README.md)
 - the online [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

# Notes on the tokenizer (Salvador)

## Commands
* scanf("%[^\n]s", str) is used to read a string including the spaces until
the next line is received or to read string until line break, that is, \n is
encountered and store it on an arrays named "str". "^\n" stands for taking
input until a new line isn't encountered.
